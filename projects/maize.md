In this project, I worked as part of a team to take daily measurements of Maize seedlings under different simulated environmental conditions. Once the dataset showed plants stopped growing we terminated them and took final 
root/shoot measurements. This entire process took around 1 month and taught me a lot about how to conduct an experiment and how to adapt when unexpected things happen. For example this group of seedlings started growing
much faster than in previous years so we were unprepared/unable to do the same measurements as them. But since our main interest was growth rate we were still able to acheive this by measuring a different leaf.

The second month was dedicated to data analysis of the dataset and visualizing the data for others to see on a poster. My poster was centered around differences between genetic backgrounds.
This was done by conducting a PCoA and ANOVA on specific traits, you can see that there are significant differences between the different genetic backgrounds. This then lead to us attempting to classify the genetic background
from the data. We found that an SVM model worked best and we were able to achieve 84.3% accuracy. This was a very good result given how some of the genetic backgrounds are branches of another so they share traits.
All of the data analysis and visualization was done using R.
