# My Software Engineering Journey: Passions, Projects, and Future Goals

I've always been drawn to software engineering because it feels like solving puzzles—but with real-world impact. 
My interests are all over the place, from data science and AI automation to game design and high-performance computing (HPC). 
Here's where I am now, what I've learned, and where I hope to grow.

## Data Science & Machine Learning: Cornfields and Code

I fell in love with data science through a project analyzing maize growth. I spent weeks dealing with messy field data, cleaning it up, and figuring out how to make it useful. But the hardest part was figuring out what to do next, what analysis should I conduct, and what models should I use. Do I go for speed and quick predictions or max out accuracy and wait hours for results? Turns out, there’s no perfect model, just trade-offs. That project taught me the full data pipeline, from raw measurements to real insights, and convinced me that ML is as much art as science.

## AI & Automation: Teaching Bots to Nitpick Code

Right now, I'm working on a project using large language models (LLMs) to automate code reviews. It's like training a picky intern to critique code style or catch bugs. 
Sometimes it works brilliantly; other times, the AI suggests fixes that would break everything. But that's the fun part—tweaking prompts, fine-tuning models, 
and seeing how close we can get to a tool that *actually* helps developers. I need to learn about integrating AI into workflows, 
and how to make it feel less like a clunky add-on and more like a teammate.

## Game Design & Graphics: Checkers and Chaos

I built a checkers game once. It was fairly simple. But creating even a simple game taught me about user experience and the importance of clean code. 
Suddenly, I wasn't just solving problems, I was making sure my grandma could click buttons without getting confused and trying my best to make the whole thing pretty. 
I'd love to dive deeper into game engines like Unity or Unreal, but for now, I'm happy tinkering with small projects.

## High-Performance Computing: The Need for Speed

HPC fascinates me because it's the backbone of scaling AI. How do you train massive models without waiting forever? 
I don't have hands-on experience yet, but I'd love to learn about parallel computing and tools like CUDA. 
Right now, my knowledge starts and ends with "GPUs are fast," but I want to understand how to squeeze every bit of power out of hardware—especially for ML applications.

## What's Next?

In the future, I see myself either working as a data scientist or diving into a master's/PhD program focused on ML. To get there, I want to:

* **Level up my ML skills**: Explore advanced algorithms and optimization techniques.
* **Build better automation tools**: Make AI-assisted code reviews more accurate and practical.
* **Experiment with game engines**: Turn my checkers game into something less... 1990s.
* **Conquer HPC basics**: Finally understand what "distributed systems" and "parallel computing" really means.

For me, software engineering is about connecting dots between fields—using AI to automate workflows, data science to build smarter systems, 
and maybe even mixing graphics with ML someday. I'm not sure where I'll land, but I'm excited to keep learning, breaking things, and (hopefully) building stuff that matters.
