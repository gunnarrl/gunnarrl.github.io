## Effort Estimation in ICS 314 Final Project

### 1. How did you guess how long tasks would take?

To guess how long work would take, I mostly thought about similar tasks I'd done before. If I had done something like it, I used that experience as a guide. For totally new tasks, my guesses were more like rough estimates: usually 2-3 hours for bigger tasks and 30-90 minutes for smaller ones. This gave me a starting point, but it wasn't very accurate at first because I was still learning.

### 2. Even though your guesses were often wrong, was it helpful to guess how long things would take beforehand? Why or why not?

At first, guessing how long tasks would take didn't seem very helpful. Because I was new, my guesses were often very different from how long things actually took. This was frustrating when tasks took longer than I thought, and it sometimes made me feel pressured instead of helping me plan.

However, even though it was tough at the start, there was a small but important benefit over time. By keep trying to guess, even when I was wrong, and then seeing how much time it really took, I slowly got better at guessing more realistically. It was a way to learn and get a better feel for how long the project's tasks would actually take.

### 3. Was it helpful to track the actual time spent? Were there any downsides to guessing and tracking?

Personally, I didn't see a big, direct benefit from carefully tracking my exact work time. I felt like I usually knew how much time and energy I was putting in. If I spent several hours on a problem, I was already aware of that, and writing it down didn't really change how I understood or handled things, as long as the work got done well.

The main downside of guessing and tracking my time was how it made me feel when I went way over my own estimates. This often made me feel frustrated and overly pressured. For example, when I tried to create the email verification feature, going much longer than my guessed time made me so frustrated that I eventually gave up on that task. I think if I hadn't been so focused on the "timer" and not meeting my guess, I might have been able to step away and try again later with a fresh mind.

### 4. How did you track your actual work time? How accurate do you think your tracking was?

I tracked my actual work time with a simple method: I started a timer when I began working on the project and paused it when I stopped. Since I usually work for long periods at a time, this method was generally good for capturing the total time. However, it couldn't tell the difference between time spent actively coding versus time spent doing research or fixing problems. I also didn't always log very short periods of work.

I believe my time tracking was fairly accurate, probably within 20-30% of the real time spent, and if anything, I likely underestimated it a bit. To make recording easier, I also tended to round the times I logged.

### 5. How much extra work was it to track your time? Did it take up a lot of your time or stop you from working on the project?

Tracking my time didn't involve much extra effort. It was just a matter of starting and stopping a timer on my phone, which was quick and didn't take much mental energy or interrupt my work. So, tracking my effort didn't take up a noticeable amount of time, and it didn't prevent me from focusing on or making progress with the project tasks.
